# Python Programs: Factorial and Math Module Tasks

This repository includes two beginner-to-intermediate level Python tasks focusing on functions, recursion, and using Python's built-in `math` module.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Description
This program defines a `factorial()` function to compute the factorial of a given number using recursion. The function is called with a sample number (5), and the result is printed.


---

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Description
This program:
- Takes a number input from the user.
- Uses the Python `math` module to calculate:
  - Square root
  - Natural logarithm (log base e)
  - Sine (in radians)
- Displays the results in a formatted manner.
